# trench

Inspiration: I made a LISP interpreter in LISP, so I figured I'd extend that idea and make one using Rust.\
Purpose: To learn the Rust programming language. Currently I intend for this to be a small project.


## currently supported features:
- car
- cdr
- quote (')
- defun & function binding
- math op: + - *
- atom
- cons
- equal
- predicate types
- equality op: >, >=, <, <=
